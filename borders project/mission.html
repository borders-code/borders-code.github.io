  <p>  I chose to do this topic because my dad is an immigrant from the Philippines who had a relatively easy journey (compared to others) to the states.
   I constantly consider the infinitives and always consider myself lucky to be in the position I am. That being said, I am always aware of my status and many of those around me lack thereof.
    I want to use my privilege to help those who have found themselves in unfortunate circumstances that came to the states in hopes of a better life than they were met with in their country of origin.</div><br></p>

</p> I choose to do this topic because in the world we live today there is an increased amount of issues that are continuing to worsen each and every day.
     Whether it is poverty, racism, homelessness or other problems that people face every day.
      I am tired of not being able to do anything bigger that addresses other needs that people have, other than just helping the average person in need that I see on my way to school and work.
      There are bigger problems that continue to worsen every day and I am hoping that this website will help to lessen one of the biggest problems that the world is debating about today.
       So many people all over the world are suffering because of this situation and I really want to help.</div><br></p>

<p> I chose to do this topic because  my parents were immigrants that migrated from Trinidad and Tobago. Luckily, they got their papers and don't have to live in fear like how most people are living today. Watching family being broken apart is so hard to watch and I wish that other people were able to get their papers like my parents and wouldn't have to worry about being caught by an ICE or immigration officer and being separated from their families. This breaks my heart to see the people being  deported work tirelessly to make it back to their family as well as seeing these little children suffering when they're watching their parents being detained and left alone and afraid. I just want to try to help in any way possible and I hope that this website helps in some way.</div><br></p>

<p> I chose to do this topic because my family and friends are immigrants. I know their stories and the hardships they’ve been through. I’m also aware of the struggles of other families and their fear of being deported. I want to help those families or individuals express their voice and keep them safe. I want to show support for their will to stay in this country and fight against those who oppose their happiness. </div><br></p>

    <p> I chose to do this topic because I feel like it's important to know what type of pain and unfairness immigrants go through on a daily basis.
      Ranging from 2-3 million immigrants get taken away from their families every year and get detained.
      This is important to know because more and more immigrants are coming to america for a better life--"The American Dream" but come here to something completely different.</div><br></p>

<em><strong> OUR GOAL</strong></em>
    <em> <p>Everyone in this group has the intention of helping undocumented immigrants because we feel as if it’s important for people to understand the creulty and injustice that they go through, Undocummented immigrants should be able to come to America and work just like any other person it’s not right to send them back just because they aren’t from here we want immigrants to feel as if they have a right to be here without getting harassed and feel like they belong here.</p></em>
