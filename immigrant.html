      <h1 id = "WhatToDo"> What To Do If Stopped By Police Or ICE </h1>
      <h2 id = "StoppedText"> Stay calm! Don’t argue, don’t lie, don’t resist. Speak clearly and confidently. <br> <br> If you don’t want to answer a question, you have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration officer asks to see documentation, you must show them if you have them. <br> <br> If an officer asks to search you, you do not have to let them, but they may pat you down if they think you have a weapon. <br> <br> If detained, you can request an attorney, but the government does not have to give you one. </h2>
      <h3 id = "WhatToDo2"> What to do if ICE officers are outside of your home </h3>
      <h4 id = "HomeText"> Stay calm and stay inside of your home. (it is safer to talk through the door) <br> <br> Ask who they are and to see their badge through the peephole. <br> <br> Ask if they have a warrant. If they do, tell them to slide it underneath the door or hold it up to a window and look to see if it was signed by a judge. If they have a warrant that was signed by a judge, you are legally required to let them in. If they do not, you do not have to let them into your home. If they have a warrant of deportation/ removal (Form I-205), you do not have to let them in. <br> <br> You have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> Don’t sign anything without a lawyer/ attorney there with you. <br> <br> If they force entry without a warrant, remain calm and do not resist. Say “I do not consent to your entry into my home or the search of my home. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want to speak to my lawyer.” </h4>
      <h5 id = "WhatToDo3">  What to do if stopped by ICE while you are driving </h5>
      <h6 id = "DrivingText">  If they ask you, show your driver's license, car registration and proof of insurance. If you don't have this, clearly state that you do not have it and listen to officers for further instructions. Don't resist and stay calm. <br> <br> Don't answer any questions. You have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> You do not have to let them search your car if they do not have a warrant. If they do have a warrant, ask to look at it. If it is not signed by a judge, they don't have the right to search your car. </h6>
      <h7 id = "WhatToDo4"> What to do if detained by ICE </h7>
      <h8 id = "DetainedText"> Remain calm, speak clearly, and confidently. <br> <br> <strong> DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING WITHOUT YOUR LAWYER/ ATTORNEY PRESENT TO REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS. </strong> <br> <br> State clearly that you wish to speak with your attorney. <br> <br> Call a family member or your attorney as soon as possible. You have the right to a phone call after arrest. <br> <br> Ask for a bond and a hearing. (even if ICE says that you do not qualify) <br> <br> Ask for all copies of your immigration documentation. </h8>
      <h9 id = "Forthakids"> What to do if ICE comes to your school </h9>
      <h10 id = "ForthakidsText"> Don't be scared. It's a frightening situation, but remain calm. <br> <br> Remain in your school and ask to use someone's phone if you don't have one to contact your parents/ guardians and tell them what is going on. (if your parents are undocumented, tell them to stay away from your school and send someone who is documented) <br> <br> ICE is legally allowed in schools, but  administration may barre them from taking you from school. <br> <br> If possible, prepare a plan with the administration in the event of an ICE officer arriving. </h10>
      <h11 id = "FinalCountdown"> For those who want a quick read: </h11>
      <h12 id = "FinalCountdownText"> Always remain calm. It is difficult to in this situation because of all the possible outcomes, but try your best to think positively. <br> <br> Avoid committing crimes of ANY kind (this includes petty crimes). Don't hop the turnstile, J-walk, skip school, etc. ICE has access to all police databases. Once you enter the system, it puts you at risk. <br> <br> Do not sign anything if you are not in the presence of your attorney. <br> <br> Prepare a plan with your family/ loved ones/ anyone that you trust. <br> <br> If you do not speak good English, carry a card around with you that states your rights. <br> <br> ICE is not your friend and will try to trick you. If they say they have a warrant, ask to see it and make sure it was signed by a judge. <br> <br> You have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> You have the right to your attorney. <br> <br> If they don't have a warrant, you don't have to let them into your home or let them search you. If they suspect a weapon, however, they have the right to pat you down. </h12>
