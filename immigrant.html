      <h2 id = "StoppedText"> Stay calm! Don’t argue, don’t lie, don’t resist. Speak clearly and confidently. <br> <br> If you don’t want to answer a question, you have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration officer asks to see documentation, you must show them if you have them. <br> <br> If an officer asks to search you, you do not have to let them, but they may pat you down if they think you have a weapon. <br> <br> If detained, you can request an attorney, but the government does not have to give you one. </h2>
      <h3 id = "WhatToDo2"> What to do if ICE officers are outside of your home </h3>
      <h4 id = "HomeText"> Stay calm and stay inside of your home. (it is safer to talk through the door) <br> <br> Ask who they are and to see their badge through the peephole. <br> <br> Ask if they have a warrant. If they do, tell them to slide it underneath the door or hold it up to a window and look to see if it was signed by a judge. If they have a warrant that was signed by a judge, you are legally required to let them in. If they do not, you do not have to let them into your home. If they have a warrant of deportation/ removal (Form I-205), you do not have to let them in. <br> <br> You have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> Don’t sign anything without a lawyer/ attorney there with you. <br> <br> If they force entry without a warrant, remain calm and do not resist. Say “I do not consent to your entry into my home or the search of my home. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I want to speak to my lawyer.” </h4>
      <h5 id = "WhatToDo3">  What to do if stopped by ICE while you are driving </h5>
      <h6 id = "DrivingText">  If they ask you, show your driver's license, car registration and proof of insurance. If you don't have this, clearly state that you do not have it and listen to officers for further instructions. Don't resist and stay calm. <br> <br> Don't answer any questions. You have the right to remain silent. <br> <br> You do not have to let them search your car if they do not have a warrant. If they do have a warrant, ask to look at it. If it is not signed by a judge, they don't have the right to search your car. </h6>
